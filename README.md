# todoListApp

This was my first iteration of a common fullstack project, the todo list. The goal was to practice every element of the CRUD process throughout the build. In this app you are able to add a task at the top of the list with a click of the submit button. You are also allowed to allocate time to that task in 30 minute increments by clicking on the the plus sign next to "0min". Once the task is complete you may delete the task by clicking on the trashcan on the right side of the list item. All four elements of the CRUD process are utilized. We create a todo item, read the list, update the time, and finally have the ability to delete it once complete.

Link, deployed to heroku: https://simple-todolist-app1.herokuapp.com/

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, MongoDB

For this app I didn't use MVC because it was a small app that could hold all the routes in one file so I didn't want to add extra complexity to this project when I was still learning the entire CRUD process.


Optimizations:

If I had a bit more time I would have cleaned up the CSS in this todo app, the list items are a bit off center and the margins aren't quite right.


Lessons Learned:

The most important thing I learned while building this project was that most apps are really just the four steps of CRUD, this fundamentally altered my understanding of how the internet works.
